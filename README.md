## 🎯 Introduction 🎯

In today’s competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. Churn analysis is a key technique used to understand and reduce customer attrition. This project focuses on examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. Using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. 🚀💡📈

## 🎯 Project Goals 🎯  
The objective of this project is to build an end-to-end churn analysis system that includes:  
- **ETL Process**: Extract, transform, and load (ETL) customer data into a SQL Server database.  
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Visualize customer data, analyze churn trends, and predict future churners.  
- **Churn Prediction Model**: Use machine learning (Random Forest) to predict customer churn based on historical data. 📊🔍⚡  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used 🛠️  
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- **Visualization**: Power BI  
- **Programming**: Python (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn)  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Classifier 🎛️📡💾

## 📂 Project Structure 📂  

1. **ETL Process in SQL Server**  
   - Install SSMS: [Download Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16)  
   - Create a database: `db_Churn`  
   - Import CSV data using SQL Server Import Wizard  
   - Set `customerId` as the primary key and ensure data integrity 🔄📂✅  

2. **Power BI Transformation & Visualization**  
   - Load transformed data into Power BI  
   - Create calculated columns and measures:  
     - `Total Customers = COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID])`  
     - `Total Churn = SUM(prod_Churn[Churn Status])`  
     - `Churn Rate = [Total Churn] / [Total Customers]`  
   - Develop dashboards for:  
     - **Demographics** (Gender, Age Group, Marital Status)  
     - **Account Info** (Payment Method, Contract, Tenure)  
     - **Geographic Analysis** (State-wise churn distribution)  
     - **Service Usage** (Internet type, subscription status)  
     - **Churn Prediction Analysis** 📈🔍🛠️  

3. **Machine Learning Model for Churn Prediction**  
   - Install Anaconda: [Installation Guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install)  
   - Load data into Jupyter Notebook  
   - Install necessary libraries:  
     ```sh
     pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
     ```
   - Train a Random Forest model:  
     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
     model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```
   - Evaluate the model and integrate predictions into Power BI 🤖📊🚀
